Our water at home tastes weird to us so we got a [Brita](https://www.brita.com/water-pitchers/monterey-longlast/) water filter pitcher. We soon discovered this would not work because we like our water cold, really cold and we quickly ran out of water from the pitcher and had to wait hours to cool the refilled pitcher. I should point out our refrigerator does not have an option to install a water line for ice or water from the door.


We had the idea of getting bottled water delivered.The water jugs you see in offices, etc. They cost about $10 per bottle depending on what you buy. Your options are distilled, which we like best, spring water, fluorinated water, etc. We settled on distilled.
Fast forward to a month ago. We get an email stating that the company won’t be delivering our water and we have to go with another company. No big deal we thought.

We arranged to have a new dispenser and three 5 gallon jugs delivered on a Friday. The delivery window was 8-12, and the driver never showed up. I called the company and they had no excuse but rescheduled me for the following Monday. Once again I had a 8-12 delivery window. If you guessed he never showed up for the second time in a row you would be right. Needless to say, I called and told them to cancel my service. The phone rep said you don’t have service yet. I said no shit, your delivery people missed two deliveries in a row. I was pissed, even more so because they seemed not to care. What is happening to customer service these days?

Thanks Julia for the beautiful  picture.
