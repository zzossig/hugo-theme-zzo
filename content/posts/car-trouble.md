Our car suddenly lost power steering yesterday and we took it today to get it looked at.
It was diagnosed as a bad serpentine belt which came loose. So is bad the right word for a broken belt?
At a relatively low cost of $175, we were on our way. I should have been a mechanic.
Side note, I decided to get up early to drive us there because I was afraid of something happening while I was in traffic and not being able to turn the car quick enough. The repair shop did not open until 8am, so we sat at a [Panera](https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/home.html) bread until 8. It was a yummy distraction.
